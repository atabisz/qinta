// The first test on this tree that paints a tinta WINDOW and reads the pixels back.
//
// Everything else that asserts on drawing paints into a bitmap: tests/render_api_shared.cpp
// hands the seam a QImage or an ID2D1Bitmap and never involves a window, a paint event
// or App's storage. That is the right shape for the seam's own assertions and it leaves
// a gap exactly where the port is riskiest -- between a widget's paintEvent and the
// abstract render target the tree draws through.
//
// WHAT IS UNDER TEST, in the order the assertions run:
//
//   1. Seated<>::install() -- the non-Windows entry point in include/seated.h, which
//      had zero callers until src/qt_init.cpp existed. Two DISTINCT instantiations
//      (RenderTarget and TextFactory), so one working says nothing about the other.
//   2. QtScopedRenderTarget's lifetime contract: App::renderTarget is non-null during
//      the paint and null after it, because the QPainter QtRenderTarget begins must
//      end before paintEvent returns.
//   3. Pixels out of QWidget::grab(). A window that paints nothing is
//      indistinguishable from a window that painted correctly unless the pixels are
//      read, and the colours here come from the real theme table rather than from
//      constants chosen to be easy.
//
// THE CONTROL IS THE POINT OF THE THIRD RUN. "Some pixels in the text band differ
// from the background" is only evidence that text was drawn if the same measurement
// can come back ZERO. So the factory is released and the window grabbed again: with
// no text factory the window paints background only, and the band must be flat. Then
// it is re-installed and grabbed a third time, which also asserts installation is
// re-callable rather than a one-shot.
